# Contributing a Policy to XPolicyLab

This page is the submission standard for `policy/<POLICY>/` adapters: what a complete adapter contains, how to test it, and what a PR must include. For repo-wide concepts and workflows, see the [README](README.md).

In Cursor, the bundled Agent Skills automate most of this: `xpolicylab-model-integration` builds an adapter, `xpolicylab-adapter-check` audits one before a PR.

## Adapter Standard

### Files

Scaffold with `bash scripts/create_policy.sh <POLICY>` (copies `policy/demo_policy/`), then keep:

```text
policy/<POLICY>/
├── README.md                    # required: install / data / train / eval guide
├── __init__.py                  # required: keeps XPolicyLab.policy.<POLICY> importable

├── deploy.yml                   # required: runtime config, protocol: ws
├── deploy.py                    # required: evaluation loop
├── model.py                     # required: Model adapter class

└── INSTALLATION.md              # optional: extra setup notes
```

`process_data.sh` / `train.sh` may be omitted only for an agreed **eval-only** submission: state it in the PR, notify the maintainers ([Contact](README.md#-contact)), and give a timeline for open-sourcing training.

### `model.py`

Define `class Model(ModelTemplate)` (`from XPolicyLab.model_template import ModelTemplate`):

| Method | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `__init__(model_cfg)` | `model_cfg` is `deploy.yml` merged with per-run overrides (`ckpt_name`, `action_type`, `env_cfg_type`, `seed`, ...). Load checkpoints and processors here. |
| `update_obs(obs)` / `update_obs_batch(obs_list)` | Store observation dict(s) for the next action call. |
| `get_action()` | Return one action chunk: `list[dict]` of numpy arrays. |
| `get_action_batch(env_idx_list=None)` | Batched chunks aligned with active env indices. |
| `reset()` | Clear model state between episodes. |

Action dictionaries use the standard keys (`left_arm_joint_state`, `right_ee_joint_state`, `ee_pose`, ...) with dimensions taken from `get_robot_action_dim_info(env_cfg_type)` in `XPolicyLab.utils.process_data` — never hard-coded. Register new robots in `utils/robot/_robot_info.json`. Observation and trajectory formats: README, [Standard Data Formats](README.md#-standard-data-formats).

`model.py` never decodes images. The policy server decodes every observation before calling `update_obs` / `update_obs_batch`, so `obs["vision"][<camera>]["color"]` is always a plain image array.

In offline code — conversion scripts and training dataloaders that read trajectory files — decode only with `decode_image_bit` from `XPolicyLab.utils.process_data`, never with hand-rolled `cv2.imdecode` / `np.frombuffer` / PIL decoding. RoboTwin/RoboDojo legacy image-bit layouts are only handled correctly by this function.

Images are RGB end to end. `decode_image_bit` returns RGB, so no channel conversion belongs in conversion, training, or eval code. The only exceptions are medium adapters: `COLOR_RGB2BGR` immediately before `cv2.VideoWriter.write(...)`, and `COLOR_BGR2RGB` immediately after `cv2.VideoCapture.read()`. A `cv2.cvtColor(decode_image_bit(...), COLOR_BGR2RGB)` anywhere means training and evaluation disagree on channel order.

### `deploy.yml`

`policy_name` must equal the directory name — the server imports `XPolicyLab.policy.<policy_name>.model`, and the setup scripts derive the name from the directory. Keep `protocol: ws` (`legacy_tcp` is for unmigrated legacy adapters only). Per-run fields are overridden by the setup scripts; put stable defaults here. Reference (`policy/demo_policy/deploy.yml`):

```yaml
policy_name: demo_policy
protocol: ws
host: localhost
port: null
bench_name: null
task_name: null
ckpt_name: null
env_cfg_type: null
seed: null
action_type: null
gpu_id: null
eval_batch: false
```

### Scripts

All adapters share the same entry-point conventions (argument meanings: README, [Common Workflow](README.md#-common-workflow)):

```bash
bash eval.sh <bench_name> <task_name> <ckpt_name> <env_cfg_type> <action_type> <seed> \
  <policy_gpu_id> <env_gpu_id> <policy_env_or_uv_path> <eval_env_conda_env>
```

`eval.sh` starts the policy server, waits for it, runs the environment client, and cleans up — keep it aligned with `policy/demo_policy/eval.sh`; document any extra arguments in the policy README. Checkpoints resolve to `checkpoints/<bench_name>-<ckpt_name>-<env_cfg_type>-<action_type>-<seed>/` unless the policy README documents another layout.

### Policy README

All policy READMEs share one template — [policy/demo_policy/README.md](policy/demo_policy/README.md) is the minimal reference, [policy/AHA_WAM/README.md](policy/AHA_WAM/README.md) shows a complex adapter (model assets, custom environment variables):

1. **Header**: `**Contributor:** ... | **Paper:** ... | **arXiv:** ... | **Original code:** ...`, then 1–3 sentences on the model and what the adapter supports; mention vendored upstream directories here.
2. **Pointer paragraph** (verbatim): shared conventions link to the root README, official results link to the [RoboDojo LeaderBoard](https://robodojo-benchmark.com/LeaderBoard).
3. **Sections in order**: `Installation`, `Data Processing`, `Training`, `Evaluation`, plus `Model Assets` / `Configuration` / `Notes` only when the adapter needs them. State explicitly when a stage is unsupported (eval-only, upstream-native data, ...).
4. **Policy-specific content only**: one command template plus one runnable example per stage, extra arguments, required environment variables, `deploy.yml` keys, checkpoint-layout deviations. Do not restate shared argument tables or the split-machine flow — link to the root README instead.

## Testing

Run these in order before opening a PR.

**1. Static checks** (repo root):

```bash
bash -n policy/<POLICY>/*.sh
python -m py_compile policy/<POLICY>/model.py policy/<POLICY>/deploy.py
```

**2. Debug closed loop** — no simulator needed; verifies imports, server startup, observation serialization, action keys and dimensions, and batch logic:

```bash
cd policy/<POLICY>
export EVAL_ENV_TYPE=debug
bash eval.sh RoboDojo stack_bowls <ckpt_name> arx_x5 joint 0 0 0 <policy_env> base
```

The run must reach `[MAIN] eval finished` with no tracebacks.

**3. Simulator evaluation** — recommended for every PR and required before a leaderboard entry is published: run the same `eval.sh` with `EVAL_ENV_TYPE=sim` (or unset) inside a RoboDojo / RoboTwin workspace and record task success rates.

## PR Standard

Title: `[policy] <POLICY>: <short summary>`, e.g. `[policy] FastWAM: add RoboDojo adapter`.

Every submission PR must include the adapter following the standard above, a working policy README, and test evidence. For **official leaderboard evaluation** ([RoboDojo](https://robodojo-benchmark.com/LeaderBoard), [RoboTwin](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/leaderboard)), the PR description must also carry a checkpoint download script — Hugging Face or ModelScope preferred — so we can reproduce your results; we evaluate and publish entries as soon as possible.

### PR description template

GitHub pre-fills this from [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md):
