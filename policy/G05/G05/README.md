## 📌 G0.5 Overview

**G0.5** is Galaxea's pretrained autoregressive vision-language-action model for general-purpose robot control. Instead of using the VLM only as a vision-language encoder for a separate action expert, G0.5 keeps the VLM as the actor: a single transformer decoder generates reasoning tokens and action tokens in one unified autoregressive stream under the same next-token prediction objective.

Key ideas from the G0.5 technical report:

1. **Unified autoregressive VLA**
   - G0.5 conditions on multi-view RGB observations, an embodiment identifier, natural-language task instruction, and robot proprioceptive state.
   - The model can first emit embodied reasoning, then continue with structured action tokens in the same generation stream.
   - Action tokens are decoded into continuous robot controls, executed in chunks, and replanned closed-loop from new observations.

2. **Cross-embodiment ActionCodec**
   - Heterogeneous robot actions are mapped into a shared 27-dimensional action space:
     `left_control(9) | left_gripper(1) | right_control(9) | right_gripper(1) | lower_body(7)`.
   - A learned residual vector-quantized action tokenizer represents semantically aligned motion groups such as left arm, right arm, and lower body.
   - Only active motion groups are emitted during action generation, avoiding unnecessary padding for idle degrees of freedom.

3. **Native chain-of-thought for control**
   - G0.5 trains reasoning and action as one token sequence, rather than treating reasoning as an external module or training-only auxiliary target.
   - The chain-of-thought span can include `Subtask`, `BBox`, `Trace`, and `ActionHint` fields for task decomposition, object grounding, 2D gripper traces, and frame-level motion hints.
   - This design improves grounding and long-horizon execution because generated reasoning is directly visible to the following action tokens.

4. **Visual memory**
   - G0.5 injects multi-second visual history through the vision encoder with factorized spatial-temporal attention.
   - Pre-training uses 6 frames sampled over a 5-second window, with stochastic history-frame dropout to reduce overfitting.
   - Historical tokens are discarded at the final layer to keep inference latency bounded.

5. **Pre-training and evaluation**
   - G0.5 is initialized from a Qwen3.5 2B VLM and pretrained on robot demonstrations from 14 embodiments together with large-scale web and embodied VQA data.
   - Robot action samples and VQA samples are optimized with the same cross-entropy objective, mixed at a VQA-to-action ratio of 1:4.
   - The model reports strong performance across diverse settings, including 82.5% zero-shot success on DROID, 87.3% on Bridge-SimplerEnv, 93.3% on RoboTwin 2.0, 98.9% on LIBERO, a 0.3136 task success score on BEHAVIOR-1K, and 76.7% average success after real-world fine-tuning on R1-Lite/R1-Pro.

## 📌 Legacy G0 / G0Plus Overview

This section preserves the G0Plus overview from earlier GalaxeaVLA releases for continuity. G0Plus and G0Tiny belong to the legacy G0/G0Plus release line. The current branch focuses on G0.5, and no longer includes the legacy G0Plus Dockerfiles, Fold Towels/Handover Gift demo guides, or pi0/pi0fast training configs. For the exact legacy README and file layout, use commit [13a16a9](https://github.com/OpenGalaxea/GalaxeaVLA/tree/13a16a9049aee8f1d799b56fccc0c5832a75fc2f). Historical checkpoints remain available in the [G0-VLA Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/OpenGalaxea/G0-VLA), including: 

   - **G0Plus_3B-base**: pretrained with **2k+ hours** of real-world robot data for fine-tuning on custom tasks.
   - **G0Tiny_250M-base**: lightweight pretrained model with **1k hours** of R1 Pro VR teleoperation data, designed for R1 Pro Orin edge deployment.
   - **G0Plus_3B-pick_and_place**: post-trained checkpoint for pick-and-place deployment.
   - **Demos** included Pick Up Anything, Fold Towels, and Handover Gift.
   - openpi-based **pi0/pi0fast** fine-tuning support.

## ⚙️ G0.5 Getting Started

### GPU Requirements

To run the pretrained G0.5 models in this repository, you need an NVIDIA GPU with at least the following specifications. These estimates assume a single GPU.

Multi-GPU fine-tuning launched through [scripts/run/finetune.sh](scripts/run/finetune.sh) uses `torchrun` distributed data parallelism by default. This improves throughput, but each GPU keeps a full model replica and it should not be described as model parallelism or as a way to reduce per-GPU model memory. Multi-node runs are controlled by environment variables such as `WORLD_SIZE`, `RANK`, `MASTER_ADDR`, and `MASTER_PORT`.

| Mode               | Memory Required | Example GPU              |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| Inference          | > 8 GB          | RTX 3090 / **RTX 4090 (Recommended)**      |
| Fine-Tuning (Full) | > 70 GB         | A100 (80GB) / H20 (96GB) |

### Installation

Tested environment:

- Linux
- Python `>=3.10.16,<3.11`
- CUDA 12.8 with PyTorch 2.7.1 wheels from the `cu128` index
- Native CUDA extensions including `flash-attn-4` and `flash-linear-attention`; make sure your CUDA runtime, compiler toolchain, and PyTorch build match
- `ffmpeg` for video-backed datasets and evaluation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenGalaxea/GalaxeaVLA
cd GalaxeaVLA

# Runtime environment
uv sync --index-strategy unsafe-best-match

# Or include development/test dependencies instead
uv sync --extra dev --index-strategy unsafe-best-match

source .venv/bin/activate
```
Before installation:
1. We recommend [installing uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) without using a conda environment.
2. If you encounter network issues, we recommend trying the following uv environment variables:
   ```bash
   export UV_DEFAULT_INDEX=https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/
   export UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR=https://gh-proxy.com/https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/download
   ```


### Model Checkpoints

Download the Hugging Face repository into `checkpoints/` so the local paths match the checked-in configs:

```bash
huggingface-cli download OpenGalaxea/G05 \
    --repo-type model \
    --local-dir checkpoints \
    --local-dir-use-symlinks False
```

Expected local layout after downloading available checkpoints and placing any separately distributed RoboTwin checkpoint:

```text
checkpoints/
├── action_tokenizer.pt
├── qwen3_5_2b_base_processor/
├── g05-base/
│   ├── .hydra/config.yaml
│   ├── checkpoints/model_state_dict.pt
│   └── dataset_stats.json
├── g05-so101/
│   ├── .hydra/config.yaml
│   ├── checkpoints/model_state_dict.pt
│   └── dataset_stats.json
├── g05-droid/
│   ├── .hydra/config.yaml
│   ├── checkpoints/model_state_dict.pt
│   └── dataset_stats.json
├── g05-libero/
│   ├── .hydra/config.yaml
│   ├── model.pt
│   └── dataset_stats.json
└── g05-robotwin20/
    ├── .hydra/config.yaml
    ├── checkpoints/model_state_dict.pt
    └── dataset_stats.json
```

With the RoboTwin checkpoint included, the full set is about 55 GB. Each G0.5 model checkpoint is about 11 GB, the shared `action_tokenizer.pt` is about 484 MB, and `qwen3_5_2b_base_processor/` is about 22 MB.

| Model | Use | Local `--ckpt_path` |
| ----- | --- | ------------------- |
| [G05-base](https://huggingface.co/OpenGalaxea/G05/tree/main/g05-base) | Fine-tuning and R1 Lite zero-shot deployment | `checkpoints/g05-base/checkpoints/model_state_dict.pt` |
| [G05-so101](https://huggingface.co/OpenGalaxea/G05/tree/main/g05-so101) | SO-100/101 zero-shot deployment | `checkpoints/g05-so101/checkpoints/model_state_dict.pt` |
| [G05-droid](https://huggingface.co/OpenGalaxea/G05/tree/main/g05-droid) | DROID zero-shot deployment | `checkpoints/g05-droid/checkpoints/model_state_dict.pt` |
| [G05-libero](https://huggingface.co/OpenGalaxea/G05/tree/main/g05-libero) | LIBERO evaluation | `checkpoints/g05-libero/model.pt` |
| [G05-robotwin20](https://huggingface.co/OpenGalaxea/G05/tree/main/g05-robotwin20) | RoboTwin 2.0 evaluation | `checkpoints/g05-robotwin20/checkpoints/model_state_dict.pt` |

Keep each checkpoint's `.hydra/config.yaml` and `dataset_stats.json` next to the downloaded weights. The inference and evaluation entrypoints resolve `dataset_stats.json` from the checkpoint parent directories, and the configs expect the shared processor at `checkpoints/qwen3_5_2b_base_processor` and the shared tokenizer at `checkpoints/action_tokenizer.pt`.

The RoboTwin checkpoint uses the same sidecar layout. If `g05-robotwin20` is distributed separately from the public Hugging Face snapshot, place it under `checkpoints/g05-robotwin20/` exactly as shown above before running evaluation.

For LIBERO, the exported config expects bundle-local sidecars. The `eval_libero.sh` command below requires these paths. If they are not included by your download tool, create symlinks:

```bash
ln -sf ../action_tokenizer.pt checkpoints/g05-libero/action_tokenizer.pt
ln -sfn ../qwen3_5_2b_base_processor checkpoints/g05-libero/hf_processor
```


### Inference on Real Robots

Real-robot deployment follows a server/client architecture. The GPU machine runs the G0.5 policy server from this repository, while the robot-side client collects raw observations, sends them over WebSocket + msgpack, receives action chunks, and executes them.

#### R1 Lite

Start the policy server on the GPU machine:

```bash
python scripts/serve_policy.py \
    --ckpt_path checkpoints/g05-base/checkpoints/model_state_dict.pt \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 8080 \
    --device cuda \
    --action_steps 16 \
    eval_embodiment=galaxea_r1lite
```

Then start the R1 Lite client on the robot machine after setting the server address in `experiments/r1lite/config.toml`:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source .venv/bin/activate
cd experiments/r1lite
python run.py --config config.toml
```

See [experiments/r1lite/README.md](experiments/r1lite/README.md) for the ROS2 topics, client/server protocol, instruction file, recording, and testing details.

#### SO-100 / SO-101

SO-100/101 deployment uses the same G0.5 policy server with a lightweight LeRobot-based client. Start the policy server on the GPU machine:

```bash
bash experiments/so100/start_server.sh checkpoints/g05-so101/checkpoints/model_state_dict.pt
```

Then set up and start the robot-side client in a separate terminal or on the robot machine:

```bash
conda env create -f experiments/so100/environment.yml
conda activate lerobot
bash experiments/so100/start_client.sh
```

Before running the client, update the camera indices and camera-slot mapping in `experiments/so100/start_client.sh`. See [experiments/so100/README.md](experiments/so100/README.md) for details.

#### DROID / Franka

DROID deployment serves the G0.5 policy from this repo and uses the separate
[OpenGalaxea/droid-franka-client](https://github.com/OpenGalaxea/droid-franka-client)
repo for robot control. Start the policy server on the GPU machine:

```bash
CHECKPOINT_DIR=checkpoints/g05-droid \
POLICY_PORT=8000 \
POLICY_DEVICE=cuda:0 \
bash experiments/droid/start_server.sh \
    model.model_arch.discrete_action=true model.model_arch.continuous_action=false
```

Then clone and configure the robot-side client:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:OpenGalaxea/droid-franka-client.git
```

See [experiments/droid/README.md](experiments/droid/README.md) and [experiments/droid/PROTOCOL.md](experiments/droid/PROTOCOL.md) for the full setup and protocol contract.

### Evaluation on LIBERO

LIBERO evaluation also uses a server/client setup. This command starts a batched policy server in the background, launches one parallel client for each LIBERO suite, then stops the server after evaluation.

```bash
bash scripts/run/eval_libero.sh checkpoints/g05-libero/model.pt \
    --num_trials 50 \
    --num_parallel 10 \
    --save_videos
```

By default, the script evaluates `libero_goal`, `libero_spatial`, `libero_object`, and `libero_10`, then writes per-suite logs and `summary.json` under `outputs/libero_eval_<checkpoint_name>/`. Use `--suites "libero_goal libero_10"` to run a subset, and append Hydra-style overrides such as `model.model_arch.discrete_action=false` when needed.

See [experiments/libero/README.md](experiments/libero/README.md) for LIBERO installation notes, generated path config, output layout, and single-suite debugging commands.

### Evaluation on RoboTwin

RoboTwin evaluation runs inside the RoboTwin simulator and requires extra simulation dependencies and assets. It uses a separate `.venv-robotwin` environment so the simulator's `sapien` 3.x dependency does not overwrite the main repository environment. Follow [experiments/robotwin/README.md](experiments/robotwin/README.md) to clone RoboTwin, download assets, create `.venv-robotwin`, and verify rendering.

Run the full RoboTwin task set:

```bash
.venv-robotwin/bin/python -u experiments/robotwin/run_robotwin_manager.py \
    task=robotwin \
    ckpt=checkpoints/g05-robotwin20/checkpoints/model_state_dict.pt \
    EVALUATION.robotwin_root=third_party/RoboTwin \
    MULTIRUN.num_gpus=8 \
    MULTIRUN.max_tasks_per_gpu=1
```

This evaluates every task listed in RoboTwin's `_eval_step_limit.yml` with the configured episode count. `dataset_stats.json` is resolved automatically from the checkpoint parent directories for the standard `g05-robotwin20` layout. Pass `EVALUATION.dataset_stats_path=/path/to/dataset_stats.json` only when the stats file lives elsewhere. Results are written under `evaluate_results/robotwin/<ckpt_tag>/<timestamp>/`, while RoboTwin-rendered videos remain under `third_party/RoboTwin/eval_result/`.

### 🔥 Fine-Tuning Base Models on Galaxea Robots

To fine-tune our models with your own data, follow four steps. See [configs/QUICK_START.md](configs/QUICK_START.md) for the config hierarchy and common edit locations.

1. Create or adapt a task config under `configs/task/`, and update the matching dataset paths under `configs/data/`. For Galaxea robot fine-tuning, start from one of the provided configs:
   - R1 Lite: [configs/task/r1lite.yaml](configs/task/r1lite.yaml) with dataset paths in [configs/data/r1lite.yaml](configs/data/r1lite.yaml).
   - R1 Pro joint-space training: [configs/task/r1pro.yaml](configs/task/r1pro.yaml) with dataset paths in [configs/data/r1pro.yaml](configs/data/r1pro.yaml).
   - R1 Pro whole-body-control training with torso state/action: [configs/task/r1pro_wbc.yaml](configs/task/r1pro_wbc.yaml) with dataset paths in [configs/data/r1pro_wbc.yaml](configs/data/r1pro_wbc.yaml).

   All three Galaxea robot data configs contain example local dataset paths and
   must be edited before training:
   - R1 Lite: replace `data/r1lite/task*_lerobot` in `configs/data/r1lite.yaml`.
   - R1 Pro: replace `data/r1pro/fold_carton_lerobot` in `configs/data/r1pro.yaml`.
   - R1 Pro WBC: replace `data/r1pro_wbc/stack_box_lerobot` in `configs/data/r1pro_wbc.yaml`.

   The paths should point to your local LeRobot dataset directories.

2. Install the required packages.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ffmpeg
   ```

3. Set your environment variables.
    - `G05_OUTPUT_DIR`: Required by `configs/train.yaml`; checkpoints and Hydra logs are written under this directory.
    - `HF_HOME` / `HF_HUB_CACHE`: Recommended cache locations for Hugging Face model and tokenizer snapshots.
    - `HF_DATASETS_CACHE`: Recommended cache location for Hugging Face datasets and LeRobot metadata.
    - `LIBERO_CONFIG_PATH`: Required only for LIBERO simulation evaluation. It points to the directory where LIBERO reads or writes `config.yaml` with `bddl_files`, `init_states`, `assets`, and dataset paths.
    - `SWANLAB_API_KEY`: Required only when `logger.type=swanlab`.
    - `WANDB_API_KEY`: Required only when `logger.type=wandb` and `logger.mode=online`.

    ```bash
    export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
    export HF_HOME=<YOUR_HF_CACHE_ROOT>
    export HF_HUB_CACHE=$HF_HOME/hub
    export HF_DATASETS_CACHE=$HF_HOME/datasets
    export G05_OUTPUT_DIR=<YOUR_OUTPUT_DIR>
    export LIBERO_CONFIG_PATH=$(pwd)/experiments/libero
    export SWANLAB_API_KEY=<YOUR_SWANLAB_API_KEY>
    ```

    Copy the repository-local environment template and fill in machine-specific paths and optional API keys:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    source .env
    ```

4. Run fine-tuning.

   ```bash
   bash scripts/run/finetune.sh <num_of_gpu> <task_path>

   # dry-run: resolve config and exit before training
   bash scripts/run/finetune.sh 1 r1pro --dry-run --max_datasets 1

   # single-GPU smoke test
   bash scripts/run/finetune.sh 1 r1pro --test --max_datasets 1 model.max_steps=<num_steps>

   # multi-GPU examples:
   bash scripts/run/finetune.sh 8 r1lite
   bash scripts/run/finetune.sh 8 r1pro
   bash scripts/run/finetune.sh 8 r1pro_wbc
   ```

   R1 Pro configs use the grouped 27D ActionCodec layout:
   `left_control(9) | left_gripper(1) | right_control(9) | right_gripper(1) | lower_body(7)`.
   The WBC variant maps `torso` into the `lower_body` group through [configs/data/parts_meta/r1pro.yaml](configs/data/parts_meta/r1pro.yaml).

#### Fine-Tuning FAQ

1. Q: How do I convert my data to a [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) dataset?

   A: The [demo datasets](https://huggingface.co/OpenGalaxea/G0-VLA/tree/main/G0Plus_Finetune_LeRobot_Datasets_Demo) are provided on Hugging Face for quick testing.

2. Q: Why can't I view the training logs in SwanLab?

   A: Make sure you set your own SwanLab `workspace` in [train.yaml](configs/train.yaml).

3. Q: Why can't I find the pretrained model?

   A: The G0.5 model config is [g05.yaml](configs/model/g05.yaml). Update `model.model_arch.pretrained_model_path` or the task-level `model.pretrained_ckpt` if your checkpoints live in custom paths.

4. Q: Why am I getting an out-of-memory (OOM) error?

   A: Make sure you have enough GPU memory as mentioned above. Alternatively, reduce `model.batch_size` in the corresponding task config under [configs/task](configs/task).

### Minimal Validation

After installation and checkpoint download, run lightweight checks before launching expensive jobs:

```bash
python tools/resolve_config.py r1pro --key model.model_arch
python tools/resolve_config.py r1pro --key data.embodiment_datasets.galaxea_r1pro.dataset_groups
python -c "import torch, g05; print(torch.__version__); print(g05.__file__)"
```

Tests are split by their runtime requirements. Synthetic/unit tests can run without real robot data, while serving, pretrained-policy, and dataset tests need CUDA, downloaded checkpoints, or local LeRobot datasets. LIBERO batch evaluation additionally assumes Linux `ss` is available because [scripts/run/eval_libero.sh](scripts/run/eval_libero.sh) uses it to wait for the policy-server port.
