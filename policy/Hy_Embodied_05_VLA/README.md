# Hy_Embodied_05_VLA

**Contributor:** RoboDojo Team | **Paper:** Hy-Embodied-0.5-VLA technical report | **arXiv:** TBD | **Original code:** https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/Hy-Embodied-0.5-VLA

`Hy_Embodied_05_VLA` adapts the Tencent Hunyuan Hy-Embodied-0.5-VLA policy to XPolicyLab/RoboDojo. Integration scripts live at this directory level; the Hy-Embodied source tree is expected at `Hy-Embodied-0.5-VLA/` (set up by `install.sh`, override with `HY_VLA_ROOT`). The default and tested `action_type` for this adapter is `ee`.

Shared conventions — argument meanings, checkpoint naming, split-machine deployment, `EVAL_ENV_TYPE` — are documented in the [XPolicyLab README](../../README.md). Official results: [RoboDojo LeaderBoard](https://robodojo-benchmark.com/LeaderBoard).

## Installation

```bash
cd XPolicyLab/policy/Hy_Embodied_05_VLA
bash install.sh
source Hy-Embodied-0.5-VLA/.venv/bin/activate
```

The policy-environment argument of the eval scripts is not a conda env: pass `uv` (which reads `deploy.yml` `policy_uv_env_path`) or an explicit Hy-Embodied project path.

## Data Processing

`process_data.sh` only computes the normalization statistics (`norm_stats.pkl`) that the policy server consumes at eval time. Hy-VLA does not use a bespoke XPolicyLab HDF5-to-LeRobot converter; use the upstream Hy-Embodied data pipeline for full data collection/conversion.

```bash
cd XPolicyLab/policy/Hy_Embodied_05_VLA
bash process_data.sh <manifest_csv> <hdf5_dir> <output_pkl> [downsample_rate] [chunk_size]

# Example: compute norm stats for a prepared RoboDojo HDF5 manifest (defaults: downsample_rate 3, chunk_size 20)
bash process_data.sh data/manifest.csv data/hdf5 Hy-VLA-RoboDojo-v3/hyvla_dojo_ckpt_v3/norm_stats.pkl 3 20
```

Relative `output_pkl` paths are resolved by the upstream script after it enters `HY_VLA_ROOT`; pass the resulting path through `deploy.yml` (`norm_path`) or `HY_VLA_NORM_PATH`.

## Training

`train.sh` does not follow the standard XPolicyLab six-argument shape: it forwards all arguments directly to the upstream `scripts/train_robodojo_umi.sh` entrypoint inside the Hy-Embodied source tree, and the run is tuned via upstream environment overrides (`EXP_ID`, `EXP_ROOT`, `PRETRAIN`, `HDF5_DIR`, `NORM_PATH`, `NUM_MACHINES`, `NPROC_PER_NODE`, `CHIEF_IP`, `INDEX`, ...).

```bash
cd XPolicyLab/policy/Hy_Embodied_05_VLA

# Single-node example
CHIEF_IP=127.0.0.1 INDEX=0 NUM_MACHINES=1 NPROC_PER_NODE=8 \
HDF5_DIR=/path/to/robodojo/hdf5 EXP_ROOT=/path/to/experiments \
bash train.sh
```

There is no `checkpoints/<bench_name>-<ckpt_name>-<env_cfg_type>-<action_type>-<seed>/` convention here: point the checkpoint path expected by `deploy.yml` (`ckpt_path`) at the trained run for evaluation. Relative `hy_root` and `ckpt_path` values are resolved against this policy directory and `hy_root`, respectively.

## Evaluation

```bash
cd XPolicyLab/policy/Hy_Embodied_05_VLA
bash eval.sh <bench_name> <task_name> <ckpt_name> <env_cfg_type> <action_type> <seed> \
  <policy_gpu_id> <env_gpu_id> <policy_uv_env> <eval_env_conda_env>

# Example: evaluate the default Hy-VLA checkpoint on stack_bowls
bash eval.sh RoboDojo stack_bowls hyvla_dojo_ckpt_v3 arx_x5 ee 0 0 0 uv <eval_env_conda_env>
```

`EVAL_ENV_TYPE=debug` runs the offline wiring check (no simulator); leave it unset or set `EVAL_ENV_TYPE=sim` for RoboDojo simulation. For split-machine deployment via `setup_eval_policy_server.sh` / `setup_eval_env_client.sh`, follow the [Deployment Flow](../../README.md#-deployment-flow).

`ckpt_name` resolution checks an explicit path, `checkpoints/`, and `Hy-VLA-RoboDojo-v3/` before falling back to `deploy.yml` `ckpt_path`.

## Configuration

Policy-specific `deploy.yml` keys worth checking before evaluation:

| Key | Notes |
|---|---|
| `hy_root` | Hy-Embodied source tree. Relative paths resolve against this policy directory; `$HY_VLA_ROOT` is used when this key is empty. |
| `ckpt_path` | Default checkpoint directory. Relative paths resolve against `hy_root`. |
| `norm_path` | Optional normalization stats path. Relative paths resolve against `hy_root`; empty uses `$HY_VLA_NORM_PATH`, then `<ckpt_path>/norm_stats.pkl`. |

Additional keys consumed by the adapter: `with_absolute`, `blend_mode`, `exc_action_size`, `exc_action_interval`, `history_cadence`, `img_history_size`, `img_history_interval`, `policy_uv_env_path`.

Policy-specific environment variables: `HY_VLA_ROOT` (Hy-Embodied source tree override), `HY_VLA_NORM_PATH` (norm-stats override when `deploy.yml` `norm_path` is empty), `HY_VLA_CKPT_PATH` (optional checkpoint override).
