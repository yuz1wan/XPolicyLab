"""Abstract base class for WAM (World-Action Model) architectures.

Supported architecture families:

1. **Single System** (`framework=single_system`)
   Action tokens are concatenated to the video DiT sequence and ride
   through the shared blocks. Variants: `vanilla` (no extra capacity) /
   `moe` (expert FFN at selected layers).

2. **Dual-System** (`framework=dual_system`)
   A separate ActionDiT consumes features from the video DiT. Variants:
   `joint_cross_attn` (bridge cross-attention after a full video forward)
   / `joint_self_attn` (MMDiT-style mixed attention at every layer, driven
   by :class:`DualSystemMoTDriver`).

3. **Tri-System** (`framework=tri_system`)
   Motus-style mixture of transformers: Wan video DiT + action expert +
   frozen VLM / understanding expert, with mixed attention implemented via
   the video backbone adapter.

Each architecture composes the backbones it owns and implements its own
``forward()``.

    Recursion matters because callers commonly bypass the root forward and call a
    nested submodule directly. The canonical case in OpenWAM is
    ``Qwen3VLBackbone.extract_features`` which calls ``self.vlm_model.model(...)``
    (the inner ``Qwen3VLModel``, skipping the LM head) — wrapping only
    ``vlm_model.forward`` would leave that path grad-tracking. Recursively wrapping
    every descendant makes the semantic complete: any entry point into the frozen
    subtree is in ``no_grad``.

    Idempotent — a marker attribute on each module prevents double-wrapping if
    ``freeze_modules`` runs more than once. ``nn.Module.modules()`` deduplicates
    via its internal memo, so cyclic registrations (e.g. test fakes with
    ``self.model = self``) are visited once.

    Safe to apply to any module: if the caller already wraps the call in a
    ``no_grad`` context (e.g. ``prepare_inputs``), the inner ``no_grad`` is a
    no-op; if the caller is inside a grad-tracking forward (the tri_system VLM
    case this actually saves memory in), it short-circuits activation saving.

    **Subtree-level semantic, not per-parameter**: a trainable child under a frozen
    parent will NOT receive gradients, because every descendant ``forward`` is
    wrapped in ``no_grad``. For partial-freeze setups (e.g. LoRA on a frozen base,
    or training only the LM head of an otherwise frozen VLM), do NOT pass the
    parent's dotted path to ``freeze_modules``; pass the specific leaves you want
    frozen instead. The current freeze list in ``configs/model/*.yaml``
    only names complete subtrees, so this limitation does not bite today.
