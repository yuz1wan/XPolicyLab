"""Convert RoboDojo official HDF5 episodes into the xr1 JSON training format.

Handles both releases:
    RoboDojo       simulation, one robot (arx_x5)
    RoboDojo_real  real robots: piper_x, piper, arx_x5

Only tasks that carry the requested `--env-cfg-type` robot are converted. In
RoboDojo_real each task belongs to exactly one robot (6 tasks each), so a
piper_x run leaves the piper and arx_x5 tasks untouched.

Per-release differences handled below:
- EE reframe matrix: simulation shares one; the real robots each need their own
  (a mismatch trains rotations the deployed adapter will not reproduce).
- EE action: RoboDojo_real records `action/*_ee_poses` and it is used directly;
  simulation has none, so the pose action is emulated by a next-state shift.
- fps: read from `additional_info/frequency`, falling back to 30 because
  several RoboDojo_real piper_x tasks omit that group.

Source layout (per task, under the bench data root):
    <SRC>/<task_name>/<env_cfg_type>/data/episode_XXXXXXX.hdf5

Output layout (under the destination root):
    <DST>/data/chunk-XXXX/episode_XXXXXXX.json
    <DST>/videos/chunk-XXXX/episode_XXXXXXX.{ego,wrist_left,wrist_right}.mp4

No path is hard-coded in this script. Everything is anchored on this file's own
location: SCRIPT_DIR -> <xr1>/scripts, XR1_DIR -> <xr1>. The data root is
discovered by walking upward from XR1_DIR looking for `data/<bench_name>`.

The video paths recorded inside each JSON, and the `paths` entry in the
generated config, are written as absolute paths so training does not depend on
the directory it is launched from. Moving the dataset therefore requires
rewriting those JSONs.

Camera mapping, matching the inference prompt built in `model.py`:
    ego         <- vision/cam_head        ("# Ego View")
    wrist_left  <- vision/cam_left_wrist  ("# Left-Wrist View")
    wrist_right <- vision/cam_right_wrist ("# Right-Wrist View")
`vision/cam_third_view` is ignored.

Written fields are exactly the ones `mibot/data/datasets/json_dataset.py`
reads, no more: num_frames, time, trajectory_type, instruction.general,
observations.{ego,wrist_left,wrist_right}[].{path,start,crop_bbox},
proprios.{left,right}_{ee_pos,ee_rotm,gripper_pos,arm_joint},
proprios.waist_pos, actions.{left,right}_{ee_pos,ee_rotm,gripper_pos},
actions.waist_pos and actions.base_vel.

ARX X5 has neither a torso joint nor a mobile base, so waist_pos and base_vel
are emitted as all-zero columns: packed action dimensions 16-19 stay at a
constant delta of 0 instead of crashing the loader on a null.
`actions.{left,right}_arm_joint` is omitted because the loader packs actions
in end-effector space only.

Action definition:
- gripper: taken straight from the source `action/*_ee_joint_states`.
- ee_pos / ee_rotm: from `action/*_ee_poses` when recorded (RoboDojo_real),
  otherwise emulated from the proprio by a next-state shift,
  action[t] = proprio[t+1], with the last frame duplicated (RoboDojo sim).

EE pose reframe: local axes are renamed to the MiBot convention through
R_new = R_cur @ P, using the same per-bench/per-robot matrices the inference
adapter applies (`_EEF_REFRAME_P_ROBODOJO` and `_EEF_REFRAME_P_ROBODOJO_REAL`
in model.py), so training and deployment agree on the end-effector frame.

Normalization statistics are recomputed from the converted episodes and
emitted as a ready-to-use hydra data config, because the shipped
`configs/data/load_washer.yaml` statistics belong to a different robot. The
rules follow `scripts/compute_robodojo_stats.py`:

- gripper, both sides: hard-coded onto [-1, 1] from the measured [0, 1] travel,
  never estimated from data. The state side (quantile) gets q01 = 0, q99 = 1.0.
  The action side (gaussian) gets mean = 0, std = 1.0 rather than the reference
  script's 0.5 / 0.5, because this loader packs a gripper delta while the
  reference chain normalizes the absolute value; see the GRIPPER_ACTION_*
  constants for the derivation.
- EE action (ee_pos / ee_aa): gaussian estimated per (step, dim) from moving
  frames only (|x| >= 1e-4), so idle frames do not spike the distribution. A
  column with fewer than 10 moving frames falls back to mean 0 / std 1.
- remaining state (arm joints): 1st/99th percentiles.

Only whole frames are sampled (a full action_length horizon), so tail-padded
frames stay out of the statistics. Everything runs in float64 and is written
as .16e so the YAML round trip is lossless.
